## Weather Dashboard

This app uses API calls to allow the user to search for a city and populate the current and forecasted weather conditions.

When the use enters a city, they will see the city's name, the current date, an icon representing the current conditions, as well as the temperature, humidity, wind speed,a nd UV index.

Additionally,the user recieves a 5-day forecast that includes the future date, an icon representing the future conditions, the temperature and humidity.

As the user searches more cities, a history of their searches remains underneath the search bar. These searches are trimmed and capitalized. 

When the user clicks on a previously searched item, the current and future forecasts are re-populated in the DOM.

When the user reloads the page, the current history remains as it was unless it is cleared.

Lastly, if the user searches a city with a high UV index, the index will be highlighted as a warning to the user.
